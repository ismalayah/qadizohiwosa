Euronymous puts a lot of neurotic care into his public persona as the ghost-paint-wearing lead singer of Mayhem, a somewhat formative (in real-life) black metal group. In a rare concert scene, we see the kind of high energy that Euronymous and his guys chase after throughout much of the film's 117-minute run time.</description></item><item><title>Netflix's Firefly Lane Will Keep Viewers Watching Despite Its Flaws | TV/Streaming</title><link>/netflixs-firefly-lane-will-keep-viewers-watching-despite-its-flaws.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/netflixs-firefly-lane-will-keep-viewers-watching-despite-its-flaws.html</guid><description>Unlike Kate, Tully would be lying—she’s really a slow-smile-“family” type deep down.

But it’s watchable bullshit. In fact, if I might add another word, it’s eminently watchable bullshit. Full of contradictions, structured with all the soundness of a Jenga tower but anchored by two good (one of them very, very good) performances, it’s the kind of series made for Netflix’s autoplay feature.</description></item><item><title>Regieleki (TCG) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</title><link>/regieleki-tcg.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/regieleki-tcg.html</guid><description>From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.
