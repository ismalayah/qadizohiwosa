Born and raised in Scotland’s picturesque capital, Edinburgh, he has a musical theatre background, and was even working part-time as a restaurant there before he got his big break on Disney’s The Lodge.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>From there it’s been uphill, with film and television appearances in a variety of different roles, allowing him to show off excellent range. Although most of his work has been dramatic, there’s some comedic elements in there, too, so no matter what kind of content you’re after, you’ll find it with Doherty. If you want to know what his most impressive performances are, then read ahead for our guide to the best Thomas Doherty movies and TV shows!</p><h2 id=h-7-descendants-2-and-3 data-injectable=false>7. Descendants 2 and 3</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=690 data-current-count=990 data-injectable=true>Doherty plays Harry Hook, son of the famous Captain, for the second and third installments of this musical fantasy franchise. Set in the world of the Disney animated classics, it follows the children of various Disney villains who’ve grown up with their banished parents, living in a settlement called Lost, and their attempts to move past their families’ complex legacies and integrate back with non-evil folk. Each film follows different descendants, and in his appearances we see Doherty use the role to show off his great singing voice. A fun romp that’s as exciting and intriguing as the original that started the entire thing, with a great performance from the Scot.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Legacies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=884 data-current-count=1184 data-injectable=true>Doherty had a 10-episode arc in this Vampire Diaries spin-off series, where he played a 600 year-old vampire named Sebastian. Legacies features plenty of characters from the show that spawned it, but mostly follows Hope Mikaalson, the daughter of Hayley Marshall and Klaus Mikaelson, as well as the descendant of various powerful but ghoulish bloodlines (think vampires, werewolves, and witches, so not exactly someone to be messed with). It begins two years after the end of the previous series, with Hope attending the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted, which provides a safe space for supernatural beings to learn to control their deadly impulses. Doherty’s character begins a relationship with Lizzie Saltzman (Jenny Boyd), and during his time on the show he’s a magnetic presence, while also showing off some humor too. A great watch for fans of the original.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. High Fidelity</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=854 data-current-count=1154 data-injectable=true>This series is a gender-swapped version of a Nick Hornby novel of the same name, and the iconic 2000 film starring John Cusack, where it manages to live up to both of those brilliant predecessors by mixing comedy and heart in the best possible way. It follows Robyn “Rob” Brooks (Zoë Kravitz), a music geek, pop culture obsessive, and owner of a vinyl store who’s constantly making Top 5 lists of things she loves, and ignoring the rest of the problems in her life. Doherty plays Liam Shawcross, a young musician from Scotland who is a partial love interest for our main lady, until she realizes how much younger than her he is. Doherty is very charming in the role, and once again gets to show off his delightful singing voice. A sweet, funny, and heartwarming watch, buoyed by great performances all-round, including Doherty’s.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. The Invitation</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=874 data-current-count=1174 data-injectable=true>Doherty takes on a truly iconic character in this modern day retelling of Dracula, playing the Prince of Darkness himself. The film begins with Evie (Nathalie Emmanuel), a floundering New Yorker who discovers she has long-lost relatives in England. She reconnects with them and is invited to a family wedding, where she meets Walter De Ville, the lord of the manor in which the festivities will take place. However, things soon take a turn as Evie learns she’s actually been lured there to become Dracula’s bride, as someone in her family needs to be sacrificed to the immortal monster in order to help them secure their familial wealth. What follows is a lot of action and thrills, with Doherty putting in a hauntingly brilliant performance that will stay with you for days afterwards. A great watch for horror fans, even if it is a little predictable at parts.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Catherine the Great</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=863 data-current-count=1163 data-injectable=true>This Sky Atlantic/HBO joint effort follows the life of the infamous Catherine the Great (Helen Mirren), the empress who ruled Russia for much of the 18th century after overthrowing her husband Peter III. It begins two years after her ascension to the throne, and we see her turn the nation into a global superpower and cultural hub, while also delving into the political intrigue of her court. A political drama at its heart, there’s plenty of big names involved in this miniseries, but Doherty manages to shine among all the stars as Pyotr Zavadovsky, Catherine’s secretary and younger lover. He puts in a powerhouse performance that matches that of the brilliant leading lady, managing to bring out plenty of emotions with his subtle but brilliant acting. Only four episodes long, there’s still plenty packed into this highly bingeable series.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Gossip Girl</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwHGSIDfrk4</figure><p data-characters=680 data-current-count=980 data-injectable=true>When a show has had a cultural impact like the original Gossip Girl, it can seem daunting to step into a sequel, but Doherty is excellent as Max Wolfe, a pansexual love interest for two other characters. The series is set almost a decade after the original concluded. Set in a Manhattan private school, it delves into things like the impact of social media on gossip, and features a much more diverse group of bitchy rich kids, with plenty of non-white and LGBTQ+ representation on the show (including Doherty). He’s excellent as the flirty, determined Max, adding panache to the part, and being a leading light in a series that doesn’t quite live up to the original.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. The Lodge</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=993 data-injectable=false>A musical mystery series, The Lodge takes a pretty simple premise and turns it into a truly compelling watch. Based on an Israeli series called North Star, it follows Skye (Sophie Simnett), a teen who moves to rural Northern Ireland with her father to run a local hotel called North Star, previously owned by Skye’s granddad Patrick. Doherty plays Sean, a mountain biking obsessive who ends up working at the hotel at the behest of Skye, and eventually ends up in a messy love triangle with her and his girlfriend at the start of the series. He’s truly excellent across the two seasons, stealing almost every scene he’s in, so if you’re a fan then this is a must-watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMm5ysrF2ptbC5wKxknaeYmr%2B1xYympq%2Bhlah6orrDZquvZaOdvLi%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html&text=The%20best%20Thomas%20Doherty%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%20best%20Thomas%20Doherty%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%20best%20Thomas%20Doherty%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%20best%20Thomas%20Doherty%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-thomas-doherty-movies-and-tv-shows.html&description=The%20best%20Thomas%20Doherty%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-mandalorian-relives-luke-skywalkers-season-2-return-with-a-cameo-we-didnt-see-coming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Mandalorian relives Luke Skywalkers season 2 return with a cameo we didnt see coming">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-best-halloween-episodes-of-our-favorite-sitcoms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The best Halloween episodes of our favorite sitcoms">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
