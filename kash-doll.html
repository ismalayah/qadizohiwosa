She lost her father when she was just a year old and was brought up by her mother and stepfather. She grew up in a rough neighborhood of Detroit with her other six siblings. To support her family, Kash had to work at a young age. She began writing short stories and poetry as an escape from reality. Growing up was difficult for her and had struggled a lot. Kash was studying business management at Henry Ford College, but after a year had to drop out to support her family being the oldest sibling of them all. She began dancing in the adult entertainment industry where she also started to rap.</p><h3>Kash Doll Career</h3><p>As Kash was growing up, she had to leave her studies and work to support her family.

In the same year, she collaborated with Icewear Vezzo, Lil STL, and Ca$h Out. After that in early 2015, she released her first mixtape, K.R.E.A.M., and also signed with BMB records.</p><p>Soon after she released her mixtape Keisha Vs. Kash Doll which received good reviews.
